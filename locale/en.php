$kendoIntro ="The Kendo, or way of the sword, is a martial art of Japanese origin focused on the handling of the most iconic weapon of Japanese culture:
  Katana Although oriental fencing techniques occupy a large part of its core, its main objective is the improvement as people of its practitioners
   through the learning and internalization of Bushido's values, the code of honor of samurai warriors. The growth in values such as
    Honor, loyalty, compassion, courage, respect ... are the true backbone of this martial art.";
$kendoIntro2 = "In addition, from a purely sporting point of view, Kendo is a very complete activity, with a great aerobic and anaerobic load.
  and that allows a lot of stress to be released. And this is so because, thanks to its protections and its bamboo sword, it is the only sport
   combat that allows you to hit with all your strength without causing damage to your teammates.";

$kendoh4 = "Kendo: The Path of the Sword";

$kendoMas1 ="The Kendo is defined by the RAE as “Martial art of Japanese origin, in which an armor and a bamboo saber is used.” The name means “path of the saber” and comes from the ideograms 剣 ken: saber / sword and 道 dō: path, path, path. In the kendo he confronts the opponent wearing an armor (bōgu) and a bamboo saber (or shinai); like in any traditional martial art, there are pre-established forms or kata, which are executed in pairs and with wooden sabers or (bokuto).";

$kendoh41="The gradations in kendo";

$kendoMas2 ="The level of a kendo practitioner is measured, as in other modern training martial arts or Gendai Budo, by the system (kyūdan) as in the case of Karate-Do and Judo through graduations. In the case of kendo, there are six basic degrees or kyū (sixth kyū being the lowest and first kyū the highest) and eight intermediate and advanced degrees or give, the first dan or shodan is the lowest and highest It can reach through exams is the eighth dan or hachidan.";

$kendoh42="Training and physical performance";

$kendoMas3 ="His training occurs in phases similar to any traditional fencing training or any Japanese martial art. It has a physical development as a base, an extensive technical part, and a part of growth in ethical and martial values.

Constant changes in rhythm and its relatively short duration make kendo competition a sport of physical explosion, thereby improving the anaerobic and physical power of kendoka.";

$kendoMas4 ="In summary, the practice of kendo and Iaido improves the physical and mental form of their practitioners.";

$iaidoIntro ="Iaido is the counterpart of kendo, the path of inner peace. It is the art of drawing the sword and together with the kendo form the two sides of the same coin. Where the kendo is explosive, the iaido is calm. It is an art that seeks perfection in each of its details, and that teaches us that every moment counts, that every detail is important. Sometimes it even makes the difference between life and death. And as they say in Japan: Ichi go Ichi e (each moment is unique)";

$iaidoIntro2 = "Iaido is the art that places the greatest emphasis on how difficult it is to achieve perfection and is a constant work to fight against the ego. Only realizing that you never reach absolute perfection and still trying to improve at every moment, you can talk about personal growth.";


$iaidoh4="Iaido, the other side of the coin";


$iaidoMas ="Externally iaido is the art of unsheathing, cutting and sheathing with a Japanese saber in the form of katas, but inwardly it is much more. In Japanese, the word “I” means “to be,” and “AI” means union, so we could translate IAIDO as “the way of union with being.” The spiritual path implies the multiplicity of ways of being and behaving morally and socially, to reach the ultimate end of man: harmonious integration with the laws of the universe.";

$iaidoMas1 ="Iaido is one of the most refined Budo (Martial Art), both technically and mentally, focused on practice with Katana. Through the repetition of the Kihón (Fundamental Movements) and the Kata (Forms of combat), the practitioner will gain total control of the body and spirit. It is practiced alone, in various imaginary situations of combat against one or several adversaries. The Iai is the technique of drawing."; 

$iaidoh41="Acting with a calm spirit"; 

$iaidoMas2 ="These techniques were born at the time when kendo was practiced with authentic saber and in real fighting and were created to deal with situations in which sitting, lying or in any other posture was attacked while having the saber sheathed. Iaido therefore improves self-control and the spirit of constant vigilance.";                      

$juegoIntro ="In Kikentai two players face each other in a Kendo match. Implement all the basic rules of a real EKF match, including the arbitration trial, the reprimands, the limited time, etc ... To win a player must score one or two points, building an opportunity and launching one of the 4 basic attacks . Your opponent will try to do the same while trying to disrupt the opponent's tricks based on tactics and techniques. All these attacks, techniques and tactics are represented in the battle deck that each player freely makes before the fight.

In the end there is only one winner. Only one is victorious from the combat area.";
